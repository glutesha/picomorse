# Picomorse
Picomorse is a RP2040 based morse code keyboard. You can make it basically out of any existing morse key or a simple tactile button.

## Operating modes
### Mouse clicks
Key press = mouse click. Simple as that.
### Dots and lines
Basically types out morse code itself.
### Decoder
Decode morse and type out actual letters on your PC. Useful when combined with a keyboard typing test. 

## Technologies
The whole project is written entirely in C++ and Arduino framework with no additional libraries. As simple as that.
